Considering that the upload-to-server approach has requirements for network, low real-time performance, and high pressure on the server when the request volume is too large, as well as the security of data transmission, we hope to complete OCR recognition directly on the end-side, while the storage space and computational capacity on the end-side are limited. and computing power is limited, so the size of the OCR model and the prediction speed have high requirements.\n",

One class of approaches considers text detection as a specific scenario in target detection and improves the adaptation based on generic target detection algorithms, such as TextBoxes [1] based on the one-stage target detector SSD [2] algorithm that adapts the target box to fit text lines with extreme aspect ratios, and CTPN [3] based on the Faster RCNN [4] architecture is improved. However, there are still some differences between text detection and target detection in terms of target information and the task itself, such as text is generally larger in length and width, often in the form of \"bars\", text lines may be dense, curved text, etc. Therefore, many algorithms dedicated to text detection have been derived, such as EAST [5], PSENet [6], DBNet [7], etc. DBNet [7], etc.\n",

Regression-based algorithms borrow from the general object detection algorithm, by setting the anchor regression detection box, or directly do pixel regression, such methods are better for regular shape text detection, but the detection of irregularly shaped text will be relatively poor, for example, CTPN [3] is better for horizontal text detection, but worse for tilted and curved text detection, SegLink [8] is better for long text, but worse for sparsely distributed text; segmentation-based algorithms introduced Mask-RCNN [9], which can reach a higher level of detection in various scenes and for various shapes of text, but the disadvantage is that post-processing is generally more complicated, so there is often a speed problem and the detection of overlapping text cannot be solved.\n",

Text recognition can generally be divided into two categories according to the shape of the text to be recognized, **regular text recognition** and **irregular text recognition**. Regular text mainly refers to printed fonts, scanned text, etc., and the text is roughly in the horizontal line position; irregular text is often not in the horizontal position, and there are problems such as bending, obscuring and blurring. Irregular text scenario is very challenging and is also the main research direction in the field of text recognition at present.\n",

On the one hand, the open source community is too rich in resources, so developers cannot quickly find a project matching the business needs from the massive code warehouse, i.e., there is the problem of \"not being able to find\"; on the other hand, in algorithm selection, the metrics on the English public data set cannot provide direct reference to the Chinese scenarios that developers often face.

Both mobile and server side, the number of images to be recognized is often very large, and they all want smaller models, higher accuracy and faster prediction speed; GPU is too expensive, and it is better to use CPU to run more economically. The lighter the model is, the less resources it takes up under the premise of meeting business requirements.\n",

In addition, OCR application scenarios are very rich, with a wide range of application needs on the server side and various mobile devices, and the diversification of hardware environments requires support for rich deployment methods, while the open source community projects focus more on algorithms and models, which are clearly undersupported in this part of predictive deployment.
